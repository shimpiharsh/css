<h2>
Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri,
 near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district.
  Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government 
  of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating
   Shivaji's birth 
</h2>  
<h3>
Shivaji belonged to Maratha family of Bhonsle clan
.[23] His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552â€“1597) 
was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, 
and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given
 deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur 
 for military expenses.
</h3>  
<h4>
At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan 
was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, 
Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his
 loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the 
 Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept 
 his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.[20]
