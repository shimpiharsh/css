Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, 
near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune
 district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth. 
 The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February 
 as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji
  Jayanti).[a][16][17] Shivaji was named after a local 
  deity, the goddess Shivai.[18][19] Shivaji's father
   Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the
    Deccan Sultanates.
